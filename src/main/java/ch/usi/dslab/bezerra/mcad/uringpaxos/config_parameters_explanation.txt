*: indicates required parameter
(): indicates a non-required parameter and its default value


=== GLOBAL PARAMETERS

<agent_class> Tells the multicast agent factory which MulticastAgent class to
instantiate (in this case, URPMcastAgent) and how to read the other config
parameters.

* "agent_class" : "URPMcastAgent"


== BATCHING (done by libmcad)
This batching is done by the URPHelperNode class, outside of the URingPaxos library.

( "enable_batching"  : true )
( "batch_size_bytes" : 30000 )
( "batch_time_ms"    : 5 )


== ZOOKEEPER LOCATION

ZooKeeper is required by the URingPaxos (Unicast [Multi-]Ring Paxos) library.
The libmcad deployer will start the ZooKeeper service at the given location with
the given parameters.

* "zookeeper" :
  {
    "location" : "node5" ,
    "port" : 2181,
    "path" : "$HOME/zoo/bin/zkServer.sh"
  } ,


== Multi-Ring Paxos global parameters (most aren't required in the config file)

( "multi_ring_lambda": 20000 )
( "multi_ring_delta_t": 10 )
( "multi_ring_start_time": current_time_millis()) to synchronize the rings, giving all them the same start time
( "multi_ring_m" : 1 )
( "deserialize_to_Message" : true )
( "deliver_skip_messages": 1 )
( "reference_ring": 0 )
( "fast_ring" : false ) --- do not set to true, as the fast-ring implementation does not yet work (as of 07/24/2015)



=== PER-RING PARAMETERS
These settings are per ring, and each ring can choose different values for those parameters.
They are all optional, with the default being as follows.

( "stable_storage": "ch.usi.da.paxos.storage.BufferArray" )
( "batch_policy": "none" )
( "p1_resend_time": 1000 )
( "p1_preexecution_number": 5000 )
( "concurrent_values": 20 )
( "quorum_size": 2 )
( "buffer_size": 2097152 )
( "trim_quorum": 2 )
( "tcp_nodelay": 1 )
( "tcp_crc": 0 )
( "learner_recovery": 1 )
( "trim_modulo": 0 )
( "auto_trim": 0 )
( "value_size": 32768 )
( "value_count": 900000 )
( "value_resend_time": 10000 )
